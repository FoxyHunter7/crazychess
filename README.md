# CrazyChess
Basically chess, but with different __crazy__ gamemodes :O

This is a passion project which I intend to fully polish over the years.
Currently the game is in its early stages, and much of the functionally is still being coded in.
> âš  For this year development has been slowed down due to a lot of work for uni.

# Game Modes
### Normal
Regular chess as you know it.
### Tiny
A tiny 4x4 chess field.
### Scramble
All pieces are scrambled on the board before the game starts.
### Dropping Tiles
The chessboard has become unstable, be careful as tiles will start falling of the board. The king is the only one who cannot fall :)
### Swap
Eevery few turns you swap colors.
### Power Ups
Power ups good & bad will appear on the board.
